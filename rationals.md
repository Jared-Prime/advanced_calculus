# 1.2 The Rational Numbers
Now we're fit to define the rational numbers.

## 1.2.0.0 Definitions
Given `a, b, c, d ∈ Z`

- equality
	- `a * d = b * c ⊨ a / b = c / d`
- addition
	- `a / b + c / d = (a * d + b * c) / b * d`
- multiplication
	- `(a / b) * (c / d) = (a * c) / (b * d)`
	
taking advantage of the associative property for clarity in the order of operations.

We'll define a rational `Q` as an ordered pair of integers, `(a, b)` where `a / b` and `b ≠ 0`. We'll use this definition throughout the remainder of the section.

Now we can define addition and multiplication in the rationals
- addition
	- `(a, b) + (c, d) = ((a * d) + (c * b), (b * d))`
- multiplication
	- `(a, b) * (c, d) = ((a * c), (b * d))`

## 1.2.1.0 (Theorem Statement)
Given `(a', b') = (a, b)` and `(c', d') = (c, d)`, then

- `(a, b) + (c, d) = (a', b') + (c', d')`
- `(a, b) * (c, d) = (a', b') * (c', d')`

## 1.2.1.1 (Theorem Proof)

## 1.2.4.1 (Theorem Statement)
Given `(a,b), (c, d), (e, f) ∈ Q`,
- communitive laws
	- `(a, b) + (c, d) = (c, d) + (a, b)`
	- `(a, b) * (c, d) = (c, d) * (a, b)`
- associative laws
	- `((a, b) + (c, d)) + (e, f) = (a, b) + ((c, d) + (e, f))`
	- `((a, b) * (c, d)) * (e, f) = (a, b) * ((c, d) * (e, f))`
- distributive laws	
	- `(a, b) * ((c, d) + (e, f)) = (a, b) * (c, d ) + (a, b) * (e, f)`
