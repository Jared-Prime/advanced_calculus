# 1.2 The Rational Numbers
Now we're fit to define the rational numbers.

## 1.2.0.0 Definitions
Given `a, b, c, d ∈ Z`

- equality
	- `a * d = b * c ⊨ a / b = c / d`
- addition
	- `a / b + c / d = (a * d + b * c) / b * d`
- multiplication
	- `(a / b) * (c / d) = (a * c) / (b * d)`
	
taking advantage of the associative property for clarity in the order of operations.
